## Welcome to GNY-001F2's Github page!

I am a Computer Science student at the University of Toronto.

I am currently extensively working on user modifications and modding assistance tools for the game Crusader Kings II:

* [CK2 Music Script Generator](https://gny-001f2.github.io/CK2-Music-Script-Generator/)
* CK2 Culture Script Generator (link coming soon)
* The City Mod (currently in design phase)
* Lands of Volaria (link coming as soon as the first release is ready)

Other projects that I am working on intermittently:

* Lineage

Projects on hold or in planning:

* The Coronation
* Relationships
* TexTris

Previous work:

* [Enable Assassins](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=636224922) (simple mod to familiarize myself with packaging  for the steam workshop)
